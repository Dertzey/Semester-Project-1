The semester project should reflect the student’s creative and technical knowledge and skills based on the first-semester curriculum. This includes design principles, project management, communication technology, and development with HTML/CSS.

Target Audience & Design: The target audience should be carefully considered, and the proposed design should reflect this. A website prototype should be made using your chosen software (Adobe XD, Figma etc.)

Final Product: A URL and zip file with the final website should be submitted. The site should be tested on a variety of devices before final delivery. The student is responsible for setting up their web host or using Netlify to deploy the site. GitHub repositories should be set to private.

Report: Submit a report discussing the design and technical aspects of the project, as well as how guidelines for WCAG, SEO and content management were handled. A template for this report is provided under ‘Resources’.

The duration of the Semester Project is four weeks (full-time) and eight weeks (part-time).
